This lesson was all about two very important building blocks of any computer program: functions and control flow.

Topic covered in this lesson included:

* Functions
* Arguments vs parameters
* Returning values
* Global vs local variables
* Control flow

The outcomes for this lesson were:

1. Create a function that takes two parameters (first and last name) and which concatenates those params and returns a single value.
2. Create a simple program that logs a different message (using IF ELSE statements) based on different input.

I created the following [pen](https://codepen.io/fellowwws/pen/JjWvNqv) on [codepen.io](http://codepen.io) to demonstrate what I had learned.
