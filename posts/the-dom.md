This lesson introduced the DOM and event listeners.Â 

The DOM is an object oriented representation of a web page, and it is what allows developers to interact a web page by using a programming language, like JavaScript.

Event listeners allow developers to respond to events, such as when a user clicks a button or when the browser has finished loading the page. Event listeners really allow for the ability to add interactivity to static web pages.

Topics covered in this lesson included:

* What is the DOM?
* Accessing the DOM
* Traversing and updating the DOM
* Attributes and CSS
* Events and event handlers

I created the following [pen](https://codepen.io/fellowwws/pen/LYWKggy) on [codepen.io](http://codepen.io) to demonstrate what I had learned.
