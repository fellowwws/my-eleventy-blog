This lesson built on the foundational knowledge of the previous lessons and introduced loops, arrays and objects, and explained how they work together.

The lesson plan for this session consisted of a demo followed by a practical task (one for each, loops, arrays and objects) to be completed by the learner in their own time.

I created the following [pen](https://codepen.io/fellowwws/pen/mdWQoVm) on [codepen.io](http://codepen.io) to demonstrate what I had learned.
