This lesson introduced programming concepts such as:Â 

* Variables
* Data Types
* Logical && arithmetic operators
* Logging values to the console
* Outputting values to the DOM

The task for this lesson was to create a programme that calculated the tip percentage of a restaurant bill.

I created the following [pen](https://codepen.io/fellowwws/pen/eYvMmRY) on [codepen.io](http://codepen.io) to demonstrate what I had learned.
